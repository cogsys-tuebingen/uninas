#### Creating subImageNet from ImageNet data

The code is adapted from [Cream of the Crop](https://github.com/microsoft/cream),
see the original [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Cream/blob/main/tools/generate_subImageNet.py).

The generated ImageNet-subset has only 100 (out of 1000) classes,
with 250 training and 50 validation images per class.
It is around 50 times smaller than the original.
